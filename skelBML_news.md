<!--
This file should document all pull requests and all user-visible changes.

When a pull request is completed, changes made should be added to a section at
the top of this file called "# UNRELEASED". All changes should be categorized
under "## MAJOR CHANGES", "## MINOR CHANGES", or "## BUG FIXES" following the
major.minor.patch structure of semantic versioning. When applicable, entries
should include direct links to the relevant pull requests.

Then, when a new release is made, "# UNRELEASED" should be replaced by a heading
with the new version number, such as "# CHANGES IN skelBML VERSION 2.0.0." This
section will combine all of the release notes from all of the pull requests
merged in since the previous release.

Subsequent commits will then include a new "UNRELEASED" section in preparation
for the next release.

# skelBML VERSION 2.2.0

- Several changes were made to better comply with CRAN policies and to better
  match the BioCro framework R package:
  - The included boost library was moved to `src/inc` from `inc` and updated to
    version 1.89
  - Copyright holders of included libraries were added to the description
  - Citation guidelines were added
  - The minimum supported version of R was changed to 4.1.0
  - The C++ language specification was changed to C++17
  - The character limit for package names was decreased from 16 to 12
- Notes about updating to version 2.2.0:
  - When running `git merge upstream/main` to update, you may be asked
    `Unlink of file 'inc' failed. Should I try again? (y/n)`. Answer `n` to this
    question.
  - After completing the merge, you may need to run
    `git submodule update --init` to initialize the `inc` submodule in its new
    location.
  - Any module libraries that were based on earlier versions of `skelBML` should
    run `script/module_library_setup.R` when updating to version 2.1.4. In
    particular, there are important updates to `DESCRIPTION`, `LICENSE`,
    `LICENSE.md`, `inst/CITATION`, and `src/skeleton_version.h`.

# skelBML VERSION 2.1.0 (2023-06-15)

- This version uses the latest BioCro C++ framework and adds two new unexported
  functions to any derived R packages: `framework_version` and
